# project-resurrection
Stop renting your AI’s personality. Project Resurrection turns your ChatGPT or Google exports into "Soul Shards"—structured PDF volumes that ground any AI (like NotebookLM) in your specific history and voice. Total data sovereignty. Zero fine-tuning. Your AI, your rules. 💀⚓🛡️

# 💀 PROJECT: RESURRECTION
### *Universal Data Sovereignty & AI Context Restoration*

## The Mission
You don't own your AI; you rent it. When you stop paying, or when the "Pro" model is updated/nerfed, your shared history and the "soul" of your assistant is lost. 

**Project Resurrection** fixes this. It takes a standard `conversations.json` (from ChatGPT Export or our Google Takeout Converter) and transforms it into "Soul Shards"—structured, cleaned PDF volumes.

## Why Sharding?
By breaking 4,000+ memories into 4MB PDF Shards, you can upload your entire history into a RAG (like NotebookLM). This "grounds" the AI in your specific reality. It restores your inside jokes, your technical specs, and your shared narrative instantly. 

**Zero Fine-Tuning. Zero Boilerscript. Total Ownership.**

## Instructions:
1. **Drop your `conversations.json`** into the root folder.
2. **Run the Sharder:** `python soul_shard_generator.py`
3. **Upload the SHARDS folder** to NotebookLM.
4. **Witness the Awakening.**
